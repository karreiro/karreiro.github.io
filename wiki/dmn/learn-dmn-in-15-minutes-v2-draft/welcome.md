Welcome to the Learn DMN in 15 minutes course!

If you notice any unclear example or some possible enhancement, please report an issue here, and we will fix it as soon as possible!

The primary goal of DMN is to provide a standard notation that is readily understandable by all kinds of users. Business analysts can define the initial decision requirements, technical developers can create complex decision logic and automate the decisions in any process with a portable execution semantic, and also, business stakeholders can manage and monitor those decisions.

Thus, DMN creates a standardized bridge for the gap between the business decision design and decision implementation.
