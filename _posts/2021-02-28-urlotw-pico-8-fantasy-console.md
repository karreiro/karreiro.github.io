<span class="bg-highlight">URLOTW</span> or URL of the week is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL with you :-)

This week the winner is **PICO-8 Fantasy Console**:
[lexaloffle.com/pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

Pico-8 is not quite _new_, but I've recently seen people using [p5js.org](https://p5js.org/) for creative coding or small challenges, and I remembered that I could use Pico-8 with a similar purpose :-)

It has a whole simplified _game-dev-focused_ environment. So, you can just open Pico-8, relax, and creatively code a simple game. All sprite editors, code editors, sound editors, and anything else lives there. I just built a snake game in minutes without overthinking about anything else than the logic itself.

It's great entertainment, and if you have one of these [Anbernic devices](https://www.amazon.es/Anbernic-Consola-Portatil-Console-videojuegos/dp/B08L68X36J/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?__mk_es_ES=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&crid=1O17GG8ADF3I9&dchild=1&keywords=anbernic+rg351p&qid=1614534249&sprefix=ambernic+%2Caps%2C190&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExVUYwU0FYTkxXMVM5JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTE0MjEwM1BRT0tPVk1USVRRSSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODEwMDYxMzQyMzlWMDRaMjNZVCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=), you can test the result of your work on handheld mode [^1]!

Have fun ;-)
