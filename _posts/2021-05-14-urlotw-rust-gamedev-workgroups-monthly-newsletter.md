This week the winner is the **Rust GameDev Workgroup's monthly newsletter (#21)"**:
[gamedev.rs/news/021/](https://gamedev.rs/news/021/).

That's one of my favorite newsletters. It's refreshing to see the fantastic results people already reach with Rust.

This month, I've noticed the "**Requests for Contribution**" section, where everyone may find simple issues to start contributing on some repositories. That's an inspiring community-friendly approach for engaging people, which is something that worths a try on other communities/projects as well :-)
