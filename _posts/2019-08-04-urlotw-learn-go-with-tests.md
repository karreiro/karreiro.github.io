<p>
  <b>URL of the week</b> ({% include urlotw-icon.html size='16px' %}) is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL with you :-)
</p>

This week the winner is **_Learn Go with test-driven development_** ([https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests)).

It's is a super engaging tutorial, and I cannot stop reading it. It teaches you simple and every-day-Go-APIs by using TDD (it looks dull when I say, but it's not).

I hope you enjoy it ;-)
