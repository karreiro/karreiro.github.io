  <b>URL of the week</b> ({% include urlotw-icon.html size='16px' %}) is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL with you :-)
</p>

This week the winner is **Hyrum's Law**:
[hyrumslaw.com](https://www.hyrumslaw.com).

It has pretty intriguing thoughts about APIs, which I believe are actually appliable in many other contexts involving user experience as a whole.

Reading that, I recalled situations when I was updating my profile picture on some website, and the image appeared outdated right after I submitted the form. Generally, we somehow guess: _- ohh, probably that's a cache issue or even eventual consistency, I don't know!_ ðŸ¤ª.

However, I don't think users should need to guess that. Also, knowing all the clauses we're singing on our ~~APIs~~ contracts help us on having more simple and predictable implementations, which benefits API users as well :-)

I hope you find this URL interesting too!
