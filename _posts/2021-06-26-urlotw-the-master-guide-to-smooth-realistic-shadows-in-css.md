<span class="bg-highlight">URLOTW</span> or URL of the week is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL with you :-)

This week the winner is **The master guide to smooth, realistic shadows in CSS**:
[dev.to/devang/the-master-guide-to-smooth-realistic-shadows-in-css-463p](https://dev.to/devang/the-master-guide-to-smooth-realistic-shadows-in-css-463p).

I got myself surprised by the use of multiple shadow layers to achieve such excellent results. Still, the [support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_box-shadow_multiple_shadows) of most of the browsers for this feature is quite extensive.

I hope you like this CSS tip too!
