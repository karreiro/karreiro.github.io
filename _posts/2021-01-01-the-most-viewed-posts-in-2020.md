Thank you if you spent a bit of your time on this humble blog during 2020. It started as a collection of my notes, and now I genuinely think about what interests the readers more.

Consequently, I started paying more attention to analytics 😅. Thus, today I'd like to share with you the most viewed posts in 2020 (in case you're wondering 👀):

- 🥉 In the **3rd place**, we have ["How to maintain DMN models on Business Central and VSCode"](/2020/10/15/how-to-maintain-dmn-models-on-business-central-and-vscode.html) - this one is quite interesting because it shows how all the pieces fit together, and how Kogito Tooling is already ready to handle most of BC use cases;

- 🥈 In the **2nd place**, we have ["DMN editor supports multiple diagrams now"](/2020/10/13/dmn-editor-supports-multiple-diagrams-now.html) - I'm glad this one has so many views because I worked very hard on this feature 🧐;

- 🥇 And finally, in the **1st place**, we have ["DMN pro-tip: BKM nodes"](/2020/01/20/dmn-pro-tip-bkm-nodes.html) - which is a handy tip for more advanced DMN users;

Interestingly, all posts are related to DMN. That makes sense, as I invested most of the year working with that :-)

Stay tuned for the news in 2021!
