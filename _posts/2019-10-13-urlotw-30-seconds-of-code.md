<span class="bg-highlight">URLOTW</span> or URL of the week is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL with you :-)

This week the winner is **30 seconds of code**:
[https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code).

I've bookmarked the **30 seconds of CSS** and **30 seconds of React**. But, you can check there some snippets of Python as well!

I hope you enjoy it ;-)
