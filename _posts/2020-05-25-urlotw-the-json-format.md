<p>
  <b>URL of the week</b> ({% include urlotw-icon.html size='16px' %}) is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL with you :-)
</p>

This week the winner is **Introducing JSON**:
[www.json.org/json-en.html](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

[![Introducing JSON website](/assets/the-json-format.png "Introducing JSON website")](/assets/the-json-format.png)

It's not a new page, but I was reading it these days, and I got myself impressed by how straightforward it is and how clear it explains JSON structures. I'll try to be that clear on my future posts or when I need to explain something that other programmers are not familiar with.

I hope you enjoy it too! :-)
