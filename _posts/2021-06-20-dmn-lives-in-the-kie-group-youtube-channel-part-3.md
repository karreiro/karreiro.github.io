The [KIE YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUjeymTM-TrwHs36388VRbw) is regularly posting quite interesting content!

Last week I had the pleasure of present my talk **How to play with DMN** at the **KieLive#36**:

During the presentation, I created a simple snake game using a DMN model (it has an interesting plot twist in the end).

Also, if you've enjoyed it, I'd recommend [KieLive#11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Q--bWibKQ), [KieLive#26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7JU0E5FN-w), and [KieLive#31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMnGDgVUwHQ) - all these lives approach the use of DMN models from different perspectives.

I hope you like it!
