<span class="bg-highlight">URLOTW</span> or URL of the week or Uniform Resource Locator of the week is a kind of post where I share a relevant URL for you :-)

This week the winner is **A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden**:
[maggieappleton.com/garden-history](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

Some weeks ago, I had a chat with one of my best friends, and he shared his learning goals for this new year. The cool thing is that he shared a link to his personal wiki while we were talking about it (thank you for that, [Elias](https://www.elias.sh)! ðŸŽ‰).

I got really intrigued by his approach to organizing knowledge and guiding his learning process. Still, I wasn't quite sure about how that worked for him and all the benefits.

**After reading Maggie Appleton's article tho, I feel like now I got the essence of this digital gardens thing** - it's more about keeping your drafts, ideas, and content that doesn't necessarily need the polishment of a blog post - but are still valuable to share.

I started exploring this scene, and it's a much more personal kind of content - I've really liked it. As you probably expect, I've started [my own personal wiki](/wiki) too, but it's still quite empty, so I'm leaving it as a "secret" URL (actually, it's just not listed in the menu ðŸ˜…).

If you feel like you're in the mood for digital gardens, leave the URL of yours here, I will absolutely like to check it! :-)
