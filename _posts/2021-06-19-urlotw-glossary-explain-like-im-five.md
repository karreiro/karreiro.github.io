Even if you already know the topics mentioned in this thread, it is still worth checking. Sometimes, we already comprehend something, but we do not have good enough words to clarify it for other people.

It has many one-tweet definitions and quick explanations that help you when you need to explain something quickly. For me, the "debouncing and throttling" part was quite pleasant to read.

I hope you like this URL too!
