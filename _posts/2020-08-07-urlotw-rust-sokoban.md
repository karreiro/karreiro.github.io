I’m having so much fun learning Rust that I’m trying to implement different kinds of challenges to continue getting familiar with the language.

Rust Sokoban is an entertaining tutorial that teaches you how to make a Sokoban copy in Rust. I hope you have a good time implementing it or even reading it ;-)
