In the last few days, I've been working on a major update for the [Learn DMN in 15 minutes](https://learn-dmn-in-15-minutes.com) course, and it's finally finished - the v2 is already online!

Some parts of the content are refreshed according to the newest versions of the DMN tooling. Also, the interactive tutorials are not getting users stuck on corner cases anymore ðŸ˜…

Every reported issue was solved, and visual enhancements were introduced. Now, it's easier to navigate between sections, and the interactions are more fluid.

All text content was converted from HTML to friendly Markdown. It makes proposing changes and enhancements in the course pages simpler.

I hope you enjoy it :-)
