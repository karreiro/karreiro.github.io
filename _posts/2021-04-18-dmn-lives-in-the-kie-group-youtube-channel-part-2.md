The [KIE YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUjeymTM-TrwHs36388VRbw) is regularly posting quite interesting content!

Last week I had the pleasure of seeing my friend [Eder](https://ederign.me) demonstrating the DMN Runner prototype at the **KieLive#30** session:

That’s a game-changer on how users built DMN models. If you enjoy the presentation, I’d recommend the [KieLive#24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HSdDQzG0wE), the [KieLive#25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoxbhfQRpF4), and the [KieLive#26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7JU0E5FN-w), yeah, 3 in a roll! These lives have enjoyable and heterogeneous content for DMN enthusiasts.

I hope you like it! ;-)
