I love the journey—understanding the context, learning new things, writing the code, and leaving bridges for developers who come later. My open‑source work is on GitHub under [@karreiro](http://github.com/karreiro). Any comments about that? [Reach out!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karreiro)

Currently, I'm working on the evolution of Liquid, pushing enhancements across the language, the standard library, and the runtime. Prior to that, I led the DMN tooling team at Red Hat, where I empowered users to build decision models with no‑code tools.

When I'm not coding, I love spending time with my family, listening to music, drawing cartoons, and sometimes doing it all at once!
