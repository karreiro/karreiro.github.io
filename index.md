My name is Guilherme Carreiro (or `@karreiro`). I like to build tools for other developers (like you!). I'm currently working at Shopify, where I focus on the developer experience and building command-line tooling.

If you're curious about **what** I'm making, check my [Github](https://github.com/karreiro). However, if you're curious about **how** I'm making stuff, check my [posts](/posts) or my [wiki](/wiki). Also, feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/karreiro_).
